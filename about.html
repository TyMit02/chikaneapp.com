        <h1>About Ty Mitchell</h1>
        <p>Hi, I’m Ty Mitchell, a 17-year-old racer who started racing at 15. This year, I started developing Chikane—a lap timing and event management app designed to meet the needs of racers like myself. After experiencing gaps in existing solutions, I set out to build an app that provides precision, simplicity, and a true racer-focused approach.</p>

        <h2>Chikane's Mission</h2>
        <p>Chikane is built by racers, for racers. Our mission is to bring accurate lap timing and seamless event management to every track and race event. We believe in creating a user-friendly and reliable tool that racers can trust.</p>

        <h2>Our Story & Vision</h2>
        <p>Chikane was born out of a passion for racing and technology. As a racer, I knew what was missing in existing lap timing tools—accuracy, ease of use, and a racer-centric design. In just a few months of development, Chikane has become a tool that I believe will make a significant impact in the racing community.</p>
        <p>My vision for Chikane is to continually improve the app based on feedback from racers, expand support to more tracks, and eventually release the app for Android users. This is just the beginning of a journey to redefine lap timing and event management for racers worldwide.</p>
