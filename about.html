        <h1>About Ty Mitchell</h1>
        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Ty Mitchell, a 17-year-old racer who started racing at 15. I built Chikane to fill a gap in lap timing and event management software that I felt was missing from the racing community. With Chikane, my goal is to provide precision timing and seamless event management for racers like myself.</p>
